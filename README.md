The Matrix – HTML/CSS Animation Project
Overview

The Matrix is a lightweight front-end project that recreates a cinematic “Matrix-style” interface using only HTML and CSS—no JavaScript required. The project consists of two connected pages: a boot/loading screen and an animated “access granted” screen featuring falling green code reminiscent of The Matrix films.

The goal of this project is to explore CSS animations, layout techniques, and visual effects while keeping the implementation simple and performant.


Features:

Pure HTML & CSS

No JavaScript or external libraries

Runs entirely in the browser

Boot / Loading Screen

Animated progress bar using CSS keyframes

Futuristic terminal-style typography and glow effects

“Enter Matrix” call-to-action

Matrix Rain Animation

Vertical streams of binary characters

Individual animation speeds and positions for variation

Glowing green text with depth and motion

Foreground content layered cleanly over the animation

Responsive & Full-Screen

Uses viewport units (vh, vw)

Scales smoothly across screen sizes

No scrolling or layout shifts



How It Works:

CSS Keyframes drive all animations:

Progress bar fill animation

Falling “code rain” effect

Vertical text flow is achieved using:

writing-mode: vertical-rl

text-orientation: upright

Layering is handled with z-index, allowing animated backgrounds without blocking user interaction.

Glow effects are created using text-shadow and box-shadow.



Purpose:

This project was built as:

A creative experiment with CSS animations

A demonstration of visual design without JavaScript

A fun homage to The Matrix aesthetic

A portfolio-ready front-end micro-project
